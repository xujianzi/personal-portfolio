# Welcome to My Portfolio

## About Me

I am a GIS and spatial data scientist with a Ph.D. in GIS, focusing on geospatial analytics, urban informatics, and public health. My research integrates spatial machine learning, mobility data (SafeGraph), and socioeconomic indicators to uncover community-level health disparities.  
Skilled in Python, SQL, Dash, and cloud-based geospatial computing (GEE, Docker), I build interactive dashboards and predictive models to translate complex spatial data into actionable insights.Research findings have been published in international journals such as AAG and IG, with interdisciplinary research and teaching experience.    
<br>
I‚Äôm currently seeking roles in data science, geospatial analytics, or urban intelligence where I can apply my expertise in spatial modeling and visualization to real-world challenges.
